# BuyMeACoffee_API_Interface
Some example C# code to use the Buy me a Coffee API


I played around with many different systems over 6 months before i got this working so i am sharing it here for you guys :D

This is a collection of code that can be used with the API over at https://www.buymeacoffee.com

BMC Function              -> File.cs
------------------------------------------------
All Supporters            -> GetActiveMembers.cs 

Members by id             -> GetOneMemberById.cs

Onetime-supporters        -> GetSupporters.cs

Onetime-supporters by ID  -> GetOneSupporterById.cs

Extra purchases           -> GetExtras.cs

Extra purchases by ID     -> GetExtraById.cs


Feel free to use this code in your projects and if it was helpful to you at all please consider donating a coffee in return https://www.buymeacoffee.com/TheJakal
